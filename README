This package allows to create an high quality native package of the
Tivoli Storage Manager Client for Debian or Ubuntu, by automatically 
repackaging the official IBM RPM packages.

The package is distributed by the author only as a source package, since 
the legality of redistributing repackaged IBM binaries is dubious at best.
The debian/README.source file explains how the binary package can be built.

Development of this package is sponsored by Seeweb <https://www.seeweb.it/>.
